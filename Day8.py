#Inheritance
#A wise man once told
#Money is either earned or inherited

'''So, we are going to create a parent and a child
and let's hopefully see how the child inherits
the parents' methods'''

#Let's create a parent first

    def __init__(self, fname, net_worth):
        self.fname = fname

        print("My name is ", fname, "Ambani",
        "and i am ", net_worth, "$ rich")

parent = Ambani('Dhirubai', '25B')

#Let's create a child and make it inherit from the parent Ambani

class Sons(Ambani): #See the difference?
    pass #Just pass it and it inherits every method from the parent
    
child = Sons('Mukesh', '50B')
child = Sons('Anil', '1B')

#See how the child inherited the method from Parent?

#If we initialize the child class using __init__()
#It won't inherit any property / method from the parent

'''Just like Kylie Jenner
This is how forbes put it.
Kylie Jenner Is Still The Youngest 
'Self-Made' Billionaire In The World

despite a lot of help from her famous family, 
she didnâ€™t inherit her business
she built it'''

Yeah, my mother built her
business from the ground up
with a million-dollar loan
from my grandfather. - Knives Out

#It will no longer inherit the properties from the parent

'''
The moment we initialize the class using __init__()
it will not inherit any properties / methods from the parent
However there's a catch!
super() function
'''

'''Use super() function with __init__() and it will 
still inherit the properties from it's parent'''

#So let's create a new parent
#New child
